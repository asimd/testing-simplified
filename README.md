### ðŸš€ About Me
Hi there, my name is Asim, and I am a QA engineer with 8 years of experience. This repository is my attempt at providing as much knwoledge as possible with as little text as possible by explaining QA processes with some real-life examples.


###  Introduction

In this repository, I aim to provide a direct and honest guide to QA processes, tools, and best practices that everyone who would like to become a QA engineer should know. I will cover everything from test planning, test types to test execution, bug tracking, reporting, and so on.

`Performance testing`: testing the software to ensure that it performs within acceptable parameters under various load and stress conditions.

`QA (Quality Assurance)`: the process of ensuring that the software meets the required quality standards and customer's requirements.

`Regression testing`: testing the software after changes have been made to ensure that existing functionality still works as intended.

`Static testing`: testing the software without actually running it, such as reviewing code or requirements documents.

`Test case`: a set of steps or instructions to be followed in order to test a specific feature or functionality of the software.

`Test plan`: a document that outlines the testing approach, objectives, and scope for a particular project or release.

`Test suite`: a collection of test cases that are executed together as part of a specific testing effort.

`Unit testing`: testing individual units or components of the software in isolation to ensure that they work as intended.
